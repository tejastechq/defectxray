# Task Instruction: Defect Detection Module for DefectXray

## Objective
Develop the Defect Detection Module to identify defects during testing phases (unit, integration, end-to-end) by integrating with testing frameworks and static code analysis tools. This module will capture test failures and log metadata for further analysis.

## Location
- `src/services/detection`
- `src/backend` (for API endpoints)

## Dependencies
- Database setup (for storing defect metadata) as outlined in `tasks/database_setup.md`.

## Expected Output
- A functional Defect Detection Module capable of integrating with Jest, Playwright, and Mocha to capture test failures.
- Integration with static code analysis tools like ESLint and SonarQube for pre-test defect identification.
- API endpoints to trigger defect detection from CI/CD pipelines.
- Defect metadata stored in the PostgreSQL database.

## Steps

### Step 1: Develop Integration Logic for Testing Frameworks
- **Description**: Create connectors to capture test failures from popular testing frameworks.
- **Actions**:
  1. Write integration scripts for Jest (unit testing) to parse test results and extract failure details (`src/services/detection/jest_connector.js`).
  2. Develop integration for Playwright (end-to-end testing) to log UI-specific failures, including browser environment data (`src/services/detection/playwright_connector.js`).
  3. Implement integration for Mocha (backend testing) to capture API or server-side test failures (`src/services/detection/mocha_connector.js`).
  4. Standardize the output format across frameworks to include test name, failure message, stack trace, and environment details.
- **Validation**: Run sample tests with each framework in a test environment to ensure failures are captured and formatted correctly. Verify data is logged to a temporary file or console output.

### Step 2: Implement Static Code Analysis Integration
- **Description**: Integrate static code analysis tools to identify potential defects before tests run.
- **Actions**:
  1. Create a wrapper for ESLint to analyze JavaScript/TypeScript code for common issues and log them as potential defects (`src/services/detection/eslint_analyzer.js`).
  2. Develop an integration with SonarQube API to fetch analysis results for broader codebase issues (e.g., security vulnerabilities, code smells) (`src/services/detection/sonarqube_analyzer.js`).
  3. Map analysis findings to a defect format compatible with test failure data (e.g., include file path, line number, issue description).
- **Validation**: Run ESLint and SonarQube scans on a sample codebase and confirm that issues are logged as defects in the expected format. Cross-check with manual review of known issues.

### Step 3: Store Defect Metadata in Database
- **Description**: Connect the detection module to the PostgreSQL database to store defect data.
- **Actions**:
  1. Use a database client library (e.g., `pg` for Node.js) to connect to the Azure PostgreSQL instance from the detection module (`src/services/detection/db_client.js`).
  2. Write insertion logic to store defect metadata in the `defects` and `tests` tables as defined in the database schema.
  3. Ensure data integrity by handling duplicate defects (e.g., based on test ID and failure signature) and updating existing records if necessary.
- **Validation**: Simulate test failures and static analysis findings, then query the database to confirm that defect metadata (e.g., failure details, environment) is stored correctly.

### Step 4: Integrate with CI/CD Tools
- **Description**: Connect the module to popular CI/CD tools for automated defect detection during builds, with a flexible adapter interface.
- **Actions**:
  1. Develop plugins or scripts for Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI to trigger defect scans on each build or pull request.
  2. Use webhooks or API calls to send build logs and test results to the DefectXray backend for analysis.
  3. Implement a generic adapter interface to support unsupported or custom CI/CD frameworks, allowing easy integration with a configuration file or minimal code.
  4. Document integration steps for each supported tool and the generic adapter in `src/detection_module/ci_cd_integration.md`.
- **Validation**: Set up a test pipeline in Jenkins and GitHub Actions to run a defect scan. Verify that build logs are sent to DefectXray and defects are detected and reported. Test the generic adapter with a mock custom CI/CD tool to ensure flexibility.

### Step 5: Error Handling and Logging
- **Description**: Ensure the module handles errors gracefully and logs issues for debugging.
- **Actions**:
  1. Implement try-catch blocks around framework integrations and API calls to handle failures (e.g., framework not installed, API timeout).
  2. Log errors and successful detections to a centralized logging system (e.g., Azure Monitor or a local file in development) with timestamps and context (`src/services/detection/logger.js`).
  3. Notify administrators of critical failures (e.g., database connection loss) via an alert mechanism (to be integrated later with notification systems).
- **Validation**: Simulate integration failures (e.g., disconnect database, provide invalid test data) and confirm that errors are logged without crashing the module. Check logs for clarity and completeness.

### Step 6: Documentation
- **Description**: Document the setup, usage, and customization of the Defect Detection Module.
- **Actions**:
  1. Create a README file in `src/services/detection` explaining how to configure integrations with testing frameworks and static analysis tools.
  2. Document the API endpoints in `src/backend/routes/README.md`, including request/response formats and authentication requirements.
  3. Provide examples of triggering detection from a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., a GitHub Actions workflow snippet).
- **Validation**: Have a developer unfamiliar with the module follow the documentation to set up and trigger detection. Ensure they can do so without additional guidance.

## Conclusion
Completing these steps will establish the Defect Detection Module for DefectXray, enabling the identification and storage of defects from testing frameworks and static analysis. This module is a critical prerequisite for severity analysis and fix recommendations, forming the foundation of the defect analysis pipeline.
