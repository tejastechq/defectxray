# Task Instruction: Fix Recommendation Engine for DefectXray

## Objective
Develop the Fix Recommendation Engine to provide actionable fix suggestions for identified defects, leveraging defect type, severity, and affected components. This module will use a knowledge base and machine learning models to generate recommendations and integrate with version control systems for historical fix data.

## Location
- `src/services/recommendation`
- `src/backend` (for API endpoints)

## Dependencies
- Database setup (for accessing defect and severity data) as outlined in `tasks/database_setup.md`.
- Defect Detection Module (for defect data input) as outlined in `tasks/defect_detection.md`.
- Severity Analysis Engine (for severity classification) as outlined in `tasks/severity_analysis.md`.

## Expected Output
- A functional Fix Recommendation Engine capable of generating fix suggestions based on defect metadata and severity, using a knowledge base and machine learning models.
- Integration with version control systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to suggest fixes from commit history.
- API endpoints to retrieve fix recommendations for defects.
- Recommendation data stored in the PostgreSQL database and accessible for reporting.

## Steps

### Step 1: Build Knowledge Base for Common Defects
- **Description**: Create a repository of known defect patterns and corresponding fixes to serve as the foundation for recommendations.
- **Actions**:
  1. Compile a static knowledge base of common defect patterns (e.g., null pointer exceptions, API timeout issues, CSS misalignments) and their fixes in a structured format (e.g., JSON or database table) (`src/services/recommendation/knowledge_base.js`).
  2. Include code snippets or pseudocode for fixes, categorized by programming language/framework (e.g., JavaScript/React for UI, Node.js for backend, SQL for database).
  3. Allow for periodic updates to the knowledge base via an admin interface or manual data entry (to be expanded in later phases).
- **Validation**: Test the knowledge base with sample defect types to ensure relevant fix suggestions are retrieved. Verify that entries cover a range of defect severities and stack layers.

### Step 2: Integrate Machine Learning Models for Dynamic Recommendations
- **Description**: Use machine learning to enhance recommendations by learning from past defect-fix pairs and adapting to project-specific patterns.
- **Actions**:
  1. Implement a basic ML model (e.g., using TensorFlow.js or a cloud service like Azure Machine Learning) to predict fix strategies based on defect metadata (e.g., error message, stack trace, severity) (`src/services/recommendation/ml_model.js`).
  2. Train the model initially with anonymized defect data from the knowledge base and open-source defect-fix datasets.
  3. Develop logic to fall back to the static knowledge base if ML confidence is low or no relevant patterns are found.
  4. Ensure data privacy by anonymizing any project-specific defect data used for training (e.g., strip proprietary code snippets).
- **Validation**: Test the ML model with a set of defects to confirm it suggests relevant fixes. Compare results against static knowledge base outputs to ensure improvement or equivalence. Verify anonymization by checking training data for sensitive information.

### Step 3: Integrate with Version Control Systems
- **Description**: Connect to version control systems to access commit history and suggest fixes based on past resolutions.
- **Actions**:
  1. Develop connectors for GitHub and GitLab APIs to fetch commit history related to files or modules affected by a defect (`src/services/recommendation/vcs_connector.js`).
  2. Implement logic to parse commit messages and diffs for relevant fix patterns (e.g., commits mentioning 'fix' or 'bug' related to the defect's file path).
  3. Rank historical fixes based on relevance (e.g., recency, match to defect type) and include them in recommendations.
  4. Secure API access with OAuth tokens stored in Azure Key Vault, ensuring no hardcoded credentials.
- **Validation**: Test with a sample repository containing known bug-fix commits. Confirm that the engine retrieves and ranks relevant commit data for a given defect. Verify secure access by ensuring tokens are not exposed in logs or code.

### Step 4: Generate and Prioritize Fix Recommendations
- **Description**: Combine inputs from the knowledge base, ML model, and version control to produce prioritized fix suggestions.
- **Actions**:
  1. Create a recommendation generator that aggregates suggestions from all sources (knowledge base, ML, VCS) and assigns confidence scores (`src/services/recommendation/recommendation_generator.js`).
  2. Prioritize recommendations based on severity (from Severity Analysis Engine), confidence score, and business impact (e.g., critical modules get higher priority).
  3. Format output to include actionable steps (e.g., code snippets, commit references, or general guidance) limited to the top 3-5 suggestions per defect.
- **Validation**: Input sample defects of varying severity and confirm that recommendations are relevant, prioritized correctly (e.g., high-severity defects get urgent fixes), and limited to a manageable number.

### Step 5: Integrate with Database for Data Retrieval and Storage
- **Description**: Connect the recommendation engine to the PostgreSQL database to fetch defect data and store recommendations.
- **Actions**:
  1. Use the database client (e.g., `pg` for Node.js) to query defects and their severity from the `defects` table (`src/services/recommendation/db_access.js`).
  2. Store recommendations in a new table `recommendations` (columns: `id`, `defect_id`, `suggestion`, `confidence`, `source`, `created_at`) linked to defects.
  3. Log recommendation generation events in `audit_logs` for traceability.
- **Validation**: Run the engine on sample defects and confirm that recommendations are stored in the database with correct linking to defect IDs. Check audit logs for generation events.

### Step 6: Create API Endpoints for Recommendations
- **Description**: Develop RESTful API endpoints to serve recommendations and collect user feedback.
- **Actions**:
  1. Implement `/api/recommendations` endpoint to return fix suggestions based on defect ID, including code snippets and explanations.
  2. Add rate-limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., max 100 requests per minute per client).
  3. Implement a feedback endpoint `/api/recommendations/feedback` to allow developers to rate recommendations (1-5 stars) and provide optional comments.
  4. Store feedback in a `recommendation_feedback` table with fields for `defect_id`, `recommendation_id`, `rating`, `comment`, and `timestamp`.
  5. Document API endpoints and feedback mechanism in `src/recommendation_engine/api_docs.md`.
- **Validation**: Test `/api/recommendations` with various defect IDs to ensure accurate suggestions. Simulate feedback submission via `/api/recommendations/feedback` and confirm data is stored correctly in the database.

### Step 7: Error Handling and Logging
- **Description**: Ensure the engine handles errors gracefully and logs issues for debugging.
- **Actions**:
  1. Implement error handling for database access failures, ML model errors, VCS API issues, or invalid defect data using try-catch blocks.
  2. Log activities, errors, and results to a centralized logging system (e.g., Azure Monitor or local file in development) with detailed context (`src/services/recommendation/logger.js`).
  3. Flag defects with recommendation failures for manual review by updating a status field in the database.
- **Validation**: Simulate failures (e.g., VCS API downtime, invalid defect data) and confirm that errors are logged, defects are flagged for review, and the engine continues processing other defects.

### Step 8: Documentation
- **Description**: Document the setup, usage, and customization of the Fix Recommendation Engine.
- **Actions**:
  1. Create a README file in `src/services/recommendation` explaining the recommendation logic, knowledge base structure, ML model usage, and VCS integration setup.
  2. Document the API endpoints in `src/backend/routes/README.md`, including request/response formats for retrieving recommendations and providing feedback.
  3. Provide examples of integrating recommendation retrieval into a development workflow or CI/CD pipeline.
- **Validation**: Have a developer unfamiliar with the engine follow the documentation to retrieve and apply recommendations. Ensure they can do so without additional guidance.

## Conclusion
Completing these steps will establish the Fix Recommendation Engine for DefectXray, enabling actionable fix suggestions for identified defects. This module enhances enterprise productivity by prioritizing and guiding defect resolution, building on the outputs of defect detection and severity analysis.
