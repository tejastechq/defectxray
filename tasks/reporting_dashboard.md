- Defect Detection Module (for defect data input) as outlined in `tasks/defect_detection.md`.
- Severity Analysis Engine (for severity classification) as outlined in `tasks/severity_analysis.md`.
- Fix Recommendation Engine (for fix suggestions) as outlined in `tasks/fix_recommendation.md`.

## Expected Output
- A responsive, modern React-based dashboard styled with Tailwind CSS for visualizing defect data.
- Features including defect statistics, severity distribution charts, trend analysis, filtering, drill-down capabilities, and report export (PDF, CSV, JSON).
- Real-time updates via WebSocket or periodic polling for live defect monitoring.
- Integration with backend APIs to fetch and display data dynamically.

## Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Frontend Project Structure
- **Description**: Initialize the React project with necessary dependencies and structure for the dashboard.
- **Actions**:
  1. Create a new React app using `create-react-app` or an existing monorepo setup in `src/frontend`.
  2. Install dependencies including `react-router-dom` for navigation, `recharts` or `chart.js` for data visualization, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
  3. Configure Tailwind CSS in the project by adding it to the build process and setting up the configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`).
  4. Organize the project structure with folders for components (`components/`), pages (`pages/`), utilities (`utils/`), and assets (`assets/`).
- **Validation**: Run the React app locally to ensure it starts without errors and Tailwind CSS styles are applied to a sample component.

### Step 2: Design Dashboard Layout
- **Description**: Create the overall layout and navigation structure for the dashboard.
- **Actions**:
  1. Develop a main layout component with a header (for navigation and branding), sidebar (for filters or quick links), and main content area (`src/frontend/components/Layout.js`).
  2. Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS classes to ensure usability on desktop and tablet devices.
  3. Create navigation routes for key views: Overview, Defect List, Severity Analysis, Trends, and Reports (`src/frontend/App.js`).
  4. Add a user profile or settings section in the header for authentication status and dashboard customization options.
- **Validation**: Test the layout across different screen sizes to confirm responsiveness. Navigate through routes to ensure seamless transitions without page reloads.

### Step 3: Implement Data Visualization Components
- **Description**: Build components to display defect statistics, severity distribution, and trends using charts and graphs.
- **Actions**:
  1. Create an Overview page component to show summary statistics (total defects, defects by severity, recent activity) using cards and simple metrics (`src/frontend/pages/Overview.js`).
  2. Develop a Severity Analysis component with a pie chart or bar chart to visualize distribution of low, medium, and high severity defects (`src/frontend/components/SeverityChart.js`).
  3. Implement a Trends component with a line chart to show defect counts over time (e.g., daily, weekly) with filters for time periods (`src/frontend/components/TrendsChart.js`).
  4. Build a Defect List component with a sortable, paginated table to display individual defects with details (ID, description, severity, status) (`src/frontend/components/DefectTable.js`).
- **Validation**: Use mock data to populate charts and tables. Confirm that visualizations render correctly, are interactive (e.g., hover tooltips), and adapt to different data volumes.

### Step 4: Add Filtering and Drill-Down Capabilities
- **Description**: Enable users to filter data and drill down into specific defect details for deeper analysis.
- **Actions**:
  1. Implement a filter sidebar or top bar with options for project, component, severity level, time range, and status (`src/frontend/components/FilterBar.js`).
  2. Add state management (e.g., React Context or Redux) to store filter selections and apply them to data queries or displayed results.
  3. Enable drill-down by making table rows or chart segments clickable, linking to a Defect Detail page with full metadata, severity rationale, and fix recommendations (`src/frontend/pages/DefectDetail.js`).
  4. Ensure filter changes dynamically update visualizations without full page reloads.
- **Validation**: Apply various filter combinations and confirm that data updates accordingly (e.g., show only high-severity defects from last week). Click on a defect or chart element to verify navigation to detailed views with correct data.

### Step 5: Implement Data Visualization
- **Description**: Create charts and tables to display defect data effectively, with performance optimization through caching.
- **Actions**:
  1. Use Chart.js to create line charts for defect trends over time (e.g., last 7 days).
  2. Implement a sortable, filterable table using TanStack Table for defect lists with columns for ID, title, severity, status, and date.
  3. Add drill-down capability to view detailed defect reports (e.g., stack traces, fix recommendations) in a modal.
  4. Integrate a caching layer with Redis on Azure Cache to store frequently accessed data like defect counts and severity distributions, reducing database load.
  5. Set cache expiration to 5 minutes for dynamic data updates.
  6. Document caching setup in `src/dashboard/caching.md`.
- **Validation**: Test chart rendering with sample data (at least 1,000 defects). Verify table sorting and filtering work across all columns. Confirm cache reduces query time by checking Redis hit/miss logs.

### Step 6: Integrate with Backend APIs
- **Description**: Connect the dashboard to backend APIs for data retrieval and user feedback on recommendations.
- **Actions**:
  1. Use Axios to fetch data from `/api/defects` and `/api/reports` endpoints.
  2. Implement pagination for defect lists to handle large datasets (e.g., 100 defects per page).
  3. Add a feedback mechanism allowing developers to rate fix recommendations (1-5 stars) via a `/api/recommendations/feedback` endpoint.
  4. Ensure feedback is linked to specific defect IDs and recommendation IDs for ML retraining.
  5. Cache API responses using Redis where applicable (e.g., for static report data).
  6. Document API integration and feedback process in `src/dashboard/api_integration.md`.
- **Validation**: Verify data loads correctly with pagination (test with page 1 and page 10). Confirm feedback submission works and is stored via API logs. Test cache integration for API calls.

### Step 7: Implement Real-Time Updates
- **Description**: Enable real-time defect updates on the dashboard with a reliable hybrid approach.
- **Actions**:
  1. Implement a hybrid WebSocket-polling mechanism: use WebSocket for low-latency updates when available, fall back to polling every 30 seconds if WebSocket connection fails.
  2. Connect to `/api/realtime` endpoint for live defect status changes.
  3. Display a small notification badge on the dashboard when new defects are detected.
  4. Document hybrid approach setup in `src/dashboard/realtime.md`.
- **Validation**: Simulate a new defect insertion and confirm the dashboard updates within 5 seconds via WebSocket. Test fallback polling by disabling WebSocket and verifying updates still occur.

### Step 8: Accessibility and Usability Enhancements
- **Description**: Ensure the dashboard is accessible and user-friendly for enterprise users.
- **Actions**:
  1. Adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards by adding ARIA labels to charts and tables, ensuring keyboard navigation, and using high-contrast colors with Tailwind CSS.
  2. Implement intuitive UX with tooltips, help icons, or onboarding modals to guide users through dashboard features.
  3. Minimize training needs by using familiar UI patterns (e.g., standard table sorting, filter dropdowns).
- **Validation**: Use accessibility tools (e.g., axe-core) to check for WCAG compliance. Conduct a usability test with a small group to confirm navigation and feature discovery are intuitive.

### Step 9: Error Handling and Logging
- **Description**: Ensure the dashboard handles errors gracefully and logs issues for debugging.
- **Actions**:
  1. Implement global error boundaries in React to catch and display user-friendly error messages for unhandled exceptions.
  2. Log frontend errors (e.g., API failures  to a centralized logging system (e.g., Azure Monitor or Sentry) for debugging (`src/frontend/utils/errorLogger.js`).
  3. Provide fallback UI states for data loading or empty datasets (e.g., 'No defects found' message).
- **Validation**: Simulate API failures, invalid data, or UI crashes to confirm error boundaries catch issues and display helpful messages. Check logs to ensure errors are recorded with sufficient detail for debugging.

### Step 10: Add Internationalization (i18n)
- **Description**: Support multiple languages to cater to global enterprise users.
- **Actions**:
  1. Implement `react-i18next` for internationalization, supporting at least English, Spanish, and German initially.
  2. Create language files for UI text (e.g., `en.json`, `es.json`, `de.json`) in `src/dashboard/i18n/`.
  3. Allow users to switch languages via a dropdown in the dashboard header.
  4. Document i18n setup in `src/dashboard/i18n_setup.md`.
- **Validation**: Test language switching to ensure all UI text updates correctly. Verify with a non-English language file that at least 90% of strings are translated.

### Step 11: Create Onboarding Materials
- **Description**: Develop materials to ease user adoption across different roles.
- **Actions**:
  1. Create concise onboarding guides for developers, QA engineers, and managers in PDF format, stored in `src/dashboard/onboarding/`.
  2. Link to demo videos showcasing key features (e.g., filtering defects, viewing recommendations).
  3. Add a 'Help' section in the dashboard UI linking to these resources.
  4. Document onboarding content creation in `src/dashboard/onboarding_process.md`.
- **Validation**: Review guides for clarity and completeness for each role. Confirm help links are accessible from the dashboard UI.

## Conclusion
Completing these steps will establish the Reporting Dashboard for DefectXray, providing a powerful, user-friendly interface for stakeholders to visualize and analyze defect data. This module completes the core user-facing component of the system, enabling enterprises to monitor, prioritize, and act on defect insights effectively.
