# Security Checklist for DefectXray MVP

## Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive security checklist for DefectXray MVP (August 2025 launch), ensuring enterprise-grade protection of sensitive defect data and compliance with industry standards (e.g., GDPR, SOC 2) during integration with CI/CD tools like Jira and Sentry.

## Security Requirements
The following security measures must be implemented across DefectXray components to safeguard data and maintain enterprise trust.

### 1. Data Protection
- **Encryption in Transit**: Use TLS 1.3 for all data transmissions (API calls, dashboard access) to prevent interception of defect data and user credentials.
- **Encryption at Rest**: Apply AES-256 encryption to sensitive fields (e.g., user feedback, defect descriptions) stored in PostgreSQL (Task 2) and audit logs (Task 6).
- **Data Masking**: Mask sensitive defect metadata (e.g., user IDs in descriptions) in dashboard views (Task 5) and API responses (Task 6) unless explicitly authorized by user role.

### 2. Authentication and Authorization
- **OAuth 2.0**: Implement OAuth 2.0 for API access (Task 6) with granular scopes (e.g., defects:read, defects:write) to restrict actions based on user or third-party tool permissions.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define roles (e.g., Admin, Analyst) with specific permissions for dashboard features (Task 5) and API endpoints (Task 6), ensuring least privilege access.
- **Session Management**: Enforce secure session handling with short-lived tokens (e.g., 1-hour expiry) and refresh mechanisms for dashboard and API access.

### 3. API Security (Task 6)
- **Rate Limiting**: Enforce configurable rate limits (default: 100/minute, max: 500/minute) to prevent denial-of-service attacks and ensure fair usage.
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all API inputs against PostgreSQL schema (Task 2) to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL, XSS).
- **Audit Logging**: Log API access metadata (user ID, endpoint, timestamp) without sensitive data, encrypted at rest, for security monitoring and compliance.

### 4. Dashboard Security (Task 5)
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement CSP to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) risks in the reporting dashboard, restricting script sources to trusted origins.
- **Secure Cookies**: Use HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite=Strict flags for dashboard session cookies to prevent unauthorized access.

### 5. Compliance and Privacy
- **GDPR Compliance**: Ensure user consent for data collection (e.g., feedback widget in Task 5) and provide data deletion mechanisms for defect data and logs upon request.
- **Data Minimization**: Collect and store only essential defect metadata and user feedback, avoiding unnecessary personal data to reduce privacy risks.
- **Third-Party Tool Integration**: Verify that integrations with Jira and Sentry (Task 3) do not expose sensitive API keys or tokens in logs or error messages.

## Validation and Testing
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct penetration testing in July 2025 with a focus on API endpoints (Task 6) and dashboard (Task 5) to identify vulnerabilities (target: no critical or high-severity findings).
- **Beta User Review**: Schedule a security review with beta users in August 2025 to validate that data protection measures meet enterprise expectations.
- **Compliance Audit**: Perform an internal audit in July 2025 against GDPR and SOC 2 Type 1 controls, documenting findings and remediation plans for MVP.

## Incident Response Plan
- **Detection**: Set up monitoring alerts for suspicious API activity (e.g., rate limit breaches) and unauthorized access attempts to dashboard.
- **Response**: Define a protocol for security incidents (e.g., data breach), including user notification within 72 hours per GDPR, and immediate token revocation.
- **Recovery**: Establish a rollback plan for compromised components, ensuring defect data backups (Task 2) are encrypted and accessible only to authorized admins.

## Timeline
- **May 2025**: Finalize security checklist and integrate requirements into task instructions (Tasks 2, 3, 5, 6).
- **June 2025**: Implement core security features (encryption, OAuth, rate limiting) in API and dashboard designs.
- **July 2025**: Conduct penetration testing and compliance audit, remediate findings.
- **August 2025**: Complete beta user security review and finalize incident response plan for MVP launch.

## Dependencies
- **Task 2 (PostgreSQL Defect Schema)**: Must support encryption at rest for sensitive data.
- **Task 3 (Import Module)**: Must secure API keys for third-party integrations.
- **Task 5 (Reporting Dashboard)**: Must implement CSP, secure cookies, and data masking.
- **Task 6 (API Endpoints)**: Must enforce OAuth, rate limiting, and audit logging.
