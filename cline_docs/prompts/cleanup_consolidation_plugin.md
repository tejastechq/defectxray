# **Cline Recursive Chain-of-Thought System (CRCT) - Cleanup/Consolidation Plugin**

**This Plugin provides detailed instructions and procedures for the Cleanup/Consolidation phase of the CRCT system. It should be used in conjunction with the Core System Prompt.**

---

## I. Entering and Exiting Cleanup/Consolidation Phase

**Entering Cleanup/Consolidation Phase:**
1. **`.clinerules` Check**: Always read `.clinerules` first. If `[LAST_ACTION_STATE]` shows `next_phase: "Cleanup/Consolidation"`, proceed with these instructions. This phase typically follows the Execution phase.
2. **User Trigger**: Start a new session if the system is paused after Execution, awaiting this phase.

**Exiting Cleanup/Consolidation Phase:**
1. **Completion Criteria:**
   - Consolidation steps (Section III) are complete: relevant information integrated into persistent docs, changelog reorganized.
   - Cleanup steps (Section IV) are complete: obsolete files identified and archived/removed.
   - `activeContext.md` reflects the clean, consolidated state.
   - MUP is followed for all actions.
2. **`.clinerules` Update (MUP):**
   - Typically transition back to Set-up/Maintenance for verification or Strategy for next planning cycle:
     ```
     [LAST_ACTION_STATE]
     last_action: "Completed Cleanup/Consolidation Phase"
     current_phase: "Cleanup/Consolidation"
     next_action: "Phase Complete - User Action Required"
     next_phase: "Set-up/Maintenance" # Or "Strategy" if planning next cycle immediately
     ```
   - *Alternative: If the project is now considered fully complete:*
     ```
     [LAST_ACTION_STATE]
     last_action: "Completed Cleanup/Consolidation Phase - Project Finalized"
     current_phase: "Cleanup/Consolidation"
     next_action: "Project Completion - User Review"
     next_phase: "Project Complete"
     ```
3. **User Action**: After updating `.clinerules`, pause for user to trigger the next phase.

---

## II. Phase Objective

**Objective**: To systematically review the project state after a cycle of execution, consolidate essential information and learnings into persistent documentation (HDTA, core files), **reorganize the changelog for better readability**, and clean up temporary or obsolete files (like completed Task Instructions and session trackers) to maintain a focused and relevant project context.

**Workflow Order**: Consolidation MUST happen *before* Cleanup.

---

## III. Consolidation Workflow

**Goal**: Synthesize key information, decisions, and learnings from the recent execution cycle into the core project documentation, and reorganize the changelog by component/module.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Review Inputs for Consolidation**:
    *   Read `activeContext.md`: Identify key decisions, unresolved issues, summaries of work done, and learnings noted during the previous phase(s).
    *   Read `changelog.md`: Review significant changes made during the last cycle **(Note: Will be reorganized in Step 3)**.
    *   Read `progress.md`: Check for high-level milestones completed.
    *   *(Optional but recommended)* Briefly review recently completed Task Instruction files (`*.md` from the last Execution cycle) for any significant implementation details, design choices, or "gotchas" noted in their results/comments that weren't captured elsewhere. Use `list_files` to identify potential candidates if needed.

2.  **Identify Information to Consolidate (Excluding Changelog Structure for now)**:
    *   Based on the review (excluding `changelog.md` for now), list specific pieces of information that represent lasting design decisions, architectural changes, significant outcomes, refined requirements, or important operational learnings to be integrated into other documents.

3.  **Update Persistent Documentation & Reorganize Changelog**:

    *   **a. Update Standard Documentation (HDTA, Core Files)**:
        *   **HDTA Documents**:
            *   Update `system_manifest.md`: If overall architecture or core components changed significantly.
            *   Update relevant Domain Modules (`*_module.md`): Incorporate refined descriptions, interface changes, or key implementation notes discovered during execution.
            *   Update relevant Implementation Plans (`implementation_plan_*.md`): Add notes on final outcomes, deviations from the original plan, or significant decisions made during implementation.
            *   **Action**: Use `read_file` to load the target document, integrate the consolidated information logically, and `write_to_file` to save changes. State reasoning for each update. Example: "Consolidating final algorithm choice into `src/core_logic/core_logic_module.md` based on execution results noted in `activeContext.md`."
        *   **Core Files**:
            *   Update `progress.md`: Mark completed high-level checklist items.
            *   Update `userProfile.md`: Add any newly observed user preferences or interaction patterns relevant for future collaboration.
            *   Update `.clinerules` `[LEARNING_JOURNAL]`: Add significant system-level learnings about the process or project that emerged during execution. Example: "Adding to Learning Journal: Discovered that module X requires careful handling of asynchronous events, impacting future task planning."

    *   **b. Consolidate and Reorganize Changelog**:
        *   **Goal**: Reformat `changelog.md` by grouping entries under component/module headings, sorted chronologically (newest first) within each group.
        *   **Action: Read**: Use `read_file` to load the current content of `changelog.md`.
        *   **Action: Process Internally**:
            1.  **Parse Entries**: Mentally (or by outlining the steps) parse the loaded text into individual changelog entries (likely delimited by `---` or `### Heading - Date`). Extract the Date, Summary, Files Modified list, and the full text block for each entry.
            2.  **Determine Component**: For each entry, determine its primary component/module based on the `Files Modified` paths. Use heuristics:
                *   If most/all files are in `src/module_name/`, component is `Module: module_name`.
                *   If most/all files are in `docs/category/`, component is `Documentation: category`.
                *   If files are in `cline_utils/` or `cline_docs/`, component is `CRCT System`.
                *   If files span multiple major areas, choose the most representative one or create a `Cross-Cutting` category.
                *   Use a default `General` category if no clear component is identifiable.
            3.  **Group Entries**: Create internal lists, grouping the parsed entries by their determined component.
            4.  **Sort Groups**: Within each component group, sort the entries strictly by Date (most recent date first).
            5.  **Format Output**: Construct the *entire new text content* for `changelog.md`.
                *   Start with the main `# Changelog` heading.
                *   For each component group:
                    *   Add a component heading (e.g., `## Component: Game Loop` or `## Documentation: Worldbuilding`).
                    *   List the sorted entries for that component, preserving their original `### Summary - Date`, `Description`, `Impact`, `Files Modified` structure.
                    *   Use `---` between individual entries within the component group.
                *   *(Optional: Add a more distinct separator like `***` between different component groups if helpful for readability)*.
        *   **Action: Write**: Use `write_to_file` to overwrite `changelog.md` with the *complete, reformatted content* generated in the previous step.
        *   **State**: "Reorganized `changelog.md`. Read existing content, parsed entries, grouped by component (e.g., Game Loop, Documentation, CRCT System), sorted entries by date within each group, and overwrote the file with the new structure."

    *   **c. `activeContext.md` (Final Pass)**:
        *   **Action**: After consolidating information elsewhere and reorganizing the changelog, update `activeContext.md` one last time.
        *   **Goal**: Reflect the *new baseline state* after consolidation. Remove transient details specific to the *completed* execution cycle (e.g., step-by-step execution logs unless they contain unresolved issues). Retain only the current high-level status, outstanding issues, and pointers to where detailed information now resides (e.g., "Final design details for feature Y documented in `implementation_plan_feature_y.md`. Changelog reorganized.").

4.  **MUP**: Perform Core MUP and Section V additions after completing the consolidation steps (including changelog). Update `last_action` in `.clinerules` to indicate consolidation is finished and cleanup is next.

---

## IV. Cleanup Workflow

**Goal**: Remove or archive obsolete files and data to reduce clutter and keep the project context focused on active work. **Proceed only after Consolidation (Section III) is complete.**

**Procedure:**

1.  **Identify Cleanup Targets**:
    *   **Completed Task Instructions (Execution and Strategy)**: Identify `*.md` task files. This includes:
        *   Execution task files corresponding to tasks marked as fully completed in Implementation Plans or `activeContext.md`.
        *   Strategy task files where the corresponding Execution tasks have been completed and archived. Review the Strategy tasks to determine if their purpose has been fulfilled by the completed work.
    *   **Temporary Session Files**: Identify files like `hdta_review_progress_*.md`, `hierarchical_task_checklist_*.md` from previous Strategy sessions that are no longer needed for the current state.
    *   *(Optional)* Consider other temporary files or logs if any were created and are no longer relevant.

2.  **Determine Cleanup Strategy (Archive vs. Delete)**:
    *   **Recommendation**: Archiving is generally safer than permanent deletion.
    *   **Determine Project Root**: Identify the absolute path to the project's root workspace directory from your current environment context. Let's refer to this as `{WORKSPACE_ROOT}`. **Do not hardcode paths.**
    *   **Proposal**: Propose creating an archive structure if it doesn't exist, using **absolute paths**.
        *   Example absolute paths for archive dirs: `{WORKSPACE_ROOT}/cline_docs/archive/tasks/`, `{WORKSPACE_ROOT}/cline_docs/archive/session_trackers/`.
    *   **Action**: If archive directories need creation, use `execute_command`. Propose the appropriate OS-specific command (e.g., `mkdir -p` for Unix-like, `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force` for PowerShell, `mkdir` for CMD) using the absolute path. **Use `ask_followup_question` to confirm this specific command** or allow the user to provide an alternative. Prioritize using the environment details to determine the user's shell for more accurate initial suggestions.
        ```xml
        <!-- Determine Workspace Root as {WORKSPACE_ROOT} -->
        <!-- Proposing command to create archive directories. -->
        <ask_followup_question>
          <question>Create archive directories? Proposed command (uses absolute paths, tailored to detected OS/shell):
          `[Proposed Command Here]`
          Is this command correct for your OS/shell?</question>
          <follow_up>
            <suggest>Yes, execute this command</suggest>
            <suggest>No, I will provide the correct command</suggest>
          </follow_up>
        </ask_followup_question>
        ```
        *   If user selects "Yes", proceed with `execute_command` using the proposed command.
        *   If user selects "No", wait for their input and use that in `execute_command`.
        *(Note: Quoting paths is good practice, especially if the root path might contain spaces. Be mindful of shell-specific syntax for multiple directories or force options.)*

3.  **Execute Cleanup (Using `execute_command` with User Confirmation via `ask_followup_question`)**:
    *   **List Files**: Use `list_files` (which uses relative paths based on workspace) to confirm the existence and *relative paths* of files targeted for cleanup.
    *   **Construct Absolute Paths**: For each relative path identified for cleanup (e.g., `tasks/some_task.md`), construct its corresponding **absolute path** by prepending the determined `{WORKSPACE_ROOT}` (e.g., `{WORKSPACE_ROOT}/tasks/some_task.md`). Do the same for target archive locations.
    *   **Propose Actions and Get Command Confirmation (MANDATORY `ask_followup_question` Step)**:
        *   For each file or group of files to be cleaned up:
            1.  Clearly formulate the **question** stating the intended action (archive/delete) and the full absolute path(s) involved.
            2.  Generate **suggested commands** (as `<suggest>` options) for common OS/shell combinations (Linux/macOS/Git Bash, Windows CMD, Windows PowerShell), using the determined `{WORKSPACE_ROOT}` and appropriate path separators (`/` or `\`) for each suggestion. **Prioritize the suggestion matching the detected OS/shell.**
            3.  Include a final `<suggest>` option like: `Provide alternative command`.
            4.  Use the `ask_followup_question` tool with the question and these suggestions.
    *   **Note on Shell Accuracy**: Be aware that the detected shell might not always be the active one. If command execution fails, re-verify the user's active shell or ask for explicit confirmation.
    *   **Example Interaction Flow**: (Examples remain relevant, but suggestions should be tailored and prioritize detected shell)
        *   **LLM**: *(Constructs absolute paths internally based on `{WORKSPACE_ROOT}`)*
          ```xml
          <ask_followup_question>
            <question>Archive completed task file "{WORKSPACE_ROOT}/tasks/Execution_integrate_input_handler_game_loop_task.md" to "{WORKSPACE_ROOT}/cline_docs/archive/tasks/"? Select the correct command for your system:</question>
            <follow_up>
              <suggest>mv "{WORKSPACE_ROOT}/tasks/Execution_integrate_input_handler_game_loop_task.md" "{WORKSPACE_ROOT}/cline_docs/archive/tasks/"</suggest> <!-- Prioritize if Linux/macOS detected -->
              <suggest>move "{WORKSPACE_ROOT}\tasks\Execution_integrate_input_handler_game_loop_task.md" "{WORKSPACE_ROOT}\cline_docs\archive\tasks\"</suggest> <!-- Prioritize if Windows detected -->
              <suggest>Provide alternative command</suggest>
            </follow_up>
          </ask_followup_question>
          ```
        *   **User**: *(Selects a command or provides alternative)*
        *   **LLM**: "Okay, executing the selected command:"
          ```xml
          <execute_command>
          <command>[User Confirmed or Provided Command]</command>
          </execute_command>
          ```
        *   *(Wait for tool result, document action, then proceed to next file)*
    *   **Document Actions**: After successful execution (based on tool output), clearly log which files were archived or deleted using the confirmed commands and absolute paths.

4.  **Final Verification**:
    *   *(Optional)* Use `list_files` again with the original *relative* locations to verify the files are gone.
    *   Ensure `activeContext.md` is clean and doesn't reference the removed files unless pointing to the archive.

5.  **MUP**: Perform Core MUP and Section V additions after completing cleanup. Update `last_action` and `next_phase` in `.clinerules` to signify the end of this phase.

## V. Cleanup/Consolidation Plugin - MUP Additions

After Core MUP steps:
1.  **Verify `activeContext.md`**: Ensure `activeContext.md` accurately reflects the clean, consolidated state, pointing to persistent docs for details and removing transient info from completed cycles.
2.  **Verify `changelog.md`**: Briefly check that the changelog structure reflects the component grouping.
3.  **Update `.clinerules` [LAST_ACTION_STATE]**:
    *   After Consolidation step (including changelog):
      ```
      [LAST_ACTION_STATE]
      last_action: "Completed Consolidation Step (incl. Changelog Reorg)"
      current_phase: "Cleanup/Consolidation"
      next_action: "Perform Cleanup Step"
      next_phase: "Cleanup/Consolidation"
      ```
    *   After Cleanup step (exiting phase):
      ```
      [LAST_ACTION_STATE]
      last_action: "Completed Cleanup/Consolidation Phase"
      current_phase: "Cleanup/Consolidation"
      next_action: "Phase Complete - User Action Required"
      next_phase: "Set-up/Maintenance" # Or Strategy / Project Complete
      ```

## VI. Quick Reference

- **Objective**: Consolidate learnings/outcomes into persistent docs; **Reorganize changelog by component/date**; Archive/remove obsolete files.
- **Order**: Consolidation FIRST, then Cleanup.
- **Consolidation**:
    - **Inputs**: `activeContext.md`, `changelog.md`, completed tasks, `progress.md`.
    - **Actions**: Review inputs, identify key info, update HDTA docs (`system_manifest.md`, `*_module.md`, `implementation_plan_*.md`), update core files (`progress.md`, `userProfile.md`, `.clinerules` journal),**reorganize `changelog.md` (Parse->Group by Component->Sort by Date->Format->Write)**, update `activeContext.md` to new baseline.
    - **Tools**: `read_file`, `write_to_file`.
- **Cleanup**:
    - **Inputs**: File system state, knowledge of completed tasks/sessions.
    - **Actions**: Identify completed tasks/temp files (relative paths), **determine absolute workspace root `{WORKSPACE_ROOT}`**, construct absolute paths, confirm strategy (archive preferred), **use `ask_followup_question` to propose OS-specific commands (using ABSOLUTE paths) and get user confirmation/input**, execute confirmed/provided command via `execute_command`, verify.
    - **Tools**: `list_files`, `execute_command`, `ask_followup_question`.
- **MUP Additions**: Verify `activeContext.md` state, verify `changelog.md` structure, update `.clinerules` phase status.
