# DefectXray System Manifest

## Project Overview
**Project Name**: DefectXray
**Purpose**: A cloud-based platform to enhance enterprise CI/CD and testing workflows by providing advanced defect severity analysis (low, medium, high) and actionable insights for prioritization. The platform complements existing defect tracking tools by focusing on classification rather than detection, with plans to integrate Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) for deeper process insights.
**Status**: In Strategy Phase, refining project plan based on user feedback and research.

## Core Architecture & Domain Modules
DefectXray is designed with a modular architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability:
- **Import Module**: Ingests defect data from tools like Jira and Sentry via APIs or manual uploads (CSV, JSON), normalizing and storing metadata in a PostgreSQL database. Supports initial ODC metadata mapping for future analysis.
- **Severity Analysis Engine**: Classifies defects into severity levels using rule-based logic initially, with override mechanisms for QA engineers and plans for machine learning (ML) integration in later phases. Will incorporate basic ODC attributes (Defect Type, Activity) in MVP.
- **Reporting Dashboard**: A React-based interface for visualizing defect counts, severity distributions, and basic exports, prioritizing usability for stakeholders. Will include initial ODC metrics (e.g., Defect Type distribution) in MVP.
- **Future Modules**: Fix Recommendation Engine, real-time dashboard updates, and advanced ODC analytics (e.g., Trigger, root cause analysis) planned for post-MVP phases.

## Development Workflow & Timeline
- **MVP Target**: August 2025, focusing on core modules (Import, Severity Analysis, Dashboard) with severity classification and basic ODC attributes (Defect Type, Activity).
- **Early Load Testing & Pilot Feedback**: August-October 2025, targeting 1,000 defects/hour with select clients to validate severity and initial ODC integration.
- **Full Feature Development**: November-December 2025, incorporating ML-enhanced analysis, additional ODC attributes (e.g., Trigger), and basic root cause analysis for process insights.
- **Public Launch**: March 2026, with scalability, advanced ODC analytics, and premium features for enterprise clients.

## Refinements & Strategic Enhancements
Based on user feedback and industry research, the following refinements are integrated into the plan:
- **Clear Severity Criteria**: Define severity levels based on industry standards (e.g., Critical: system crashes; Major: functionality impact with workarounds; Minor: cosmetic issues).
- **Customization**: Allow enterprises to tailor severity rules to their workflows, enhancing adoption.
- **Seamless Integration**: Support real-time syncing with tools like Jira and Sentry to reduce manual effort.
- **User Feedback Loop**: Implement mechanisms for users to override classifications and provide feedback for continuous improvement, supporting both severity and ODC attributes.
- **Phased ODC Integration**: Start with severity and basic ODC attributes (Defect Type, Activity) for MVP (August 2025); introduce additional attributes (e.g., Trigger) and advanced analytics (root cause analysis) post-MVP (November 2025 onward), using rule-based logic initially and ML for automation later. ODC implementation will be in-house, leveraging public resources (e.g., IEEE papers, Chillarege documentation).
- **Performance Metrics**: Track accuracy metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) for classification validation, especially post-ML integration, covering both severity and ODC classifications.
- **Scalability & Security**: Design for high defect volumes (1,000 defects/hour) and ensure compliance with data security standards (e.g., GDPR).
- **Data Challenges for ODC**: Address gaps in ODC-relevant metadata (e.g., from Jira) via heuristics, user prompts during import, and future ML inference to ensure accurate classification.
- **Training for ODC**: Plan in-house training for team members on ODC methodology using public documentation, with optional external consulting (e.g., Chillarege Inc.) if faster expertise is needed.

## Module Registry
- **Import Module**: Responsible for data ingestion, normalization, and initial ODC metadata mapping.
- **Severity Analysis Engine**: Core classification logic for severity and ODC attributes, with user override mechanisms.
- **Reporting Dashboard**: Visualization and stakeholder reporting for severity and ODC metrics.

## Links to Implementation Plans & Task Instructions
- To be developed in the Strategy phase, including detailed plans for each module and task instructions for MVP components, with specific focus on ODC integration tasks.

## Changelog Summary
- Initial draft created during Set-up/Maintenance phase.
- Updated during Strategy phase to reflect user feedback on severity focus, detailed ODC integration strategy, and enterprise needs.

## Additional Notes
- The phased approach to ODC ensures MVP simplicity while building toward a comprehensive defect management platform with both tactical (severity prioritization) and strategic (process insights) value.
- Dependency analysis will be conducted to sequence tasks effectively, ensuring integration and scalability for both severity and ODC components.
