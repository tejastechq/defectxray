# Active Context for DefectXray

## Current State
- **Phase**: Strategy
- **Last Action**: Updated task documents (Tasks 1, 3, 5, and 6) with user-provided improvements and clarifications for DefectXray MVP, focusing on classification accuracy, usability, security, and performance within the June-December 2025 timeline.
- **Task Progress**:
  - **Task 1 (Severity Mapping Rules)**: Updated with custom keyword validation warnings, configurable severity weights (70% Defect Type, 30% Activity), expanded validation dataset (20-30 defects from 3-4 CI/CD pipelines), and data collection plan for June 2025. Deliverables track 80% precision metric.
  - **Task 3 (Import Module)**: Updated with keyword priority default for parsing, flexible batch processing target (1-3 minutes for 10,000 defects), manual override analysis for MVP, and expanded testing for missing metadata.
  - **Task 5 (Reporting Dashboard)**: Updated with drill-down table sorting (Severity DESC, Created At DESC), simplified feedback widget (single rating, 75% satisfaction target), and chart performance limits with 'Other' category UI note.
  - **Task 6 (API Endpoints)**: Updated with `defects:read/write` OAuth scopes, configurable rate limits (default 100/minute, up to 500), and metadata-only audit logging for MVP.
- **Current Focus**: Finalizing Strategy phase by ensuring all task documents are aligned with user vision and beta success metrics (80% precision, 75% satisfaction, Lighthouse score 85, 2-3 beta users). Preparing to transition to Execution phase upon user confirmation.

## Decisions and Rationale
- **Prioritization**: Focused on accuracy (Tasks 1, 3) and security (Task 6) as top priorities per user guidance, with usability (Task 5) as secondary to meet timeline constraints.
- **Scope Adjustments**: Deferred non-critical features (e.g., Task 3 complex regex, Task 5 full accessibility) to post-MVP (January 2026) to protect beta timeline (November-December 2025).
- **Metrics Integration**: Added beta success metrics to task deliverables for tracking during development and beta phases.

## Priorities and Next Steps
- **Immediate Priority**: Obtain user confirmation on updated task documents and alignment with DefectXray MVP vision. Address any additional feedback or use cases by May 7, 2025.
- **Next Action**: Transition to Execution phase starting with Tasks 1 and 2 (severity rules, database schema) if confirmed. If further refinements are needed, iterate on Strategy phase documents.
- **Timeline**: Complete Strategy phase updates by May 10, 2025, to support June 2025 execution start. Draft implementation plan by May 12, 2025, for June-August development.

## Decisions & Priorities
- **Primary Goal**: Develop a cloud-based platform for defect severity analysis to aid prioritization in enterprise CI/CD workflows, targeting an MVP by August 2025, enhanced by ODC for strategic process insights.
- **Key Decisions**: 
  - Focus on severity classification (low, medium, high) with basic ODC attributes (Defect Type, Activity) for MVP.
  - Plan for post-MVP integration of additional ODC attributes (e.g., Trigger) and advanced analytics (root cause analysis) by November 2025, using rule-based logic initially and ML later.
  - Implement ODC in-house using public resources (e.g., IEEE papers, Chillarege documentation), with optional consulting if needed.
  - Ensure integration with tools like Jira and Sentry, with customization for enterprise needs and mechanisms to handle ODC metadata gaps via heuristics and user prompts.
  - Incorporate user feedback mechanisms to build trust and improve both severity and ODC classifications over time.
- **Priorities**: 
  - Validate task instructions and dependencies for MVP components to ensure readiness for Execution phase.
  - Address stakeholder concerns (accuracy, security, customization, training) through beta feedback planning.
  - Confirm with the user any final adjustments to task scope or sequencing before transitioning to Execution phase.

## Impact & Next Steps
- **Impact**: The completed task instructions provide a clear roadmap for DefectXray's MVP development, aligning with immediate enterprise needs for defect prioritization and setting a strong foundation for long-term value through ODC-driven process insights.
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Review updated task instructions (Tasks 1, 3, 5, and 6) for completeness and alignment with user feedback on classification accuracy, dashboard interactivity, and API security.
  - Confirm with user if the project plan and task instructions meet expectations for the MVP focused on severity classification and ODC integration.
  - Transition to Execution phase to begin implementation of DefectXray MVP components, starting with database schema and severity rules (Tasks 1 and 2), pending user confirmation.

## Key Documents
- **System Manifest**: `cline_docs/system_manifest.md` - Defines high-level architecture and ODC integration strategy.
- **Progress Tracker**: `cline_docs/progress.md` - Tracks completed and pending actions.
- **Implementation Plan**: `src/implementation_plan_mvp_severity_odc.md` - Outlines MVP objectives and timeline.
- **Task Instructions**: `tasks/task_1_severity_mapping_rules.md`, `tasks/task_2_postgresql_defect_schema.md`, `tasks/task_3_import_module.md`, `tasks/task_4_severity_analysis_engine.md`, `tasks/task_5_reporting_dashboard.md`, `tasks/task_6_api_endpoints.md` - Detailed plans for each MVP component with recent updates for enhanced features.

## Notes
- User feedback emphasized improving classification accuracy with custom configurations and validation, enhancing dashboard usability with interactive features, and ensuring secure API integration, which have been incorporated into updated task instructions.
- Mandatory Update Protocol (MUP) ensures synchronization of `activeContext.md` and `.clinerules` with each significant action to maintain project alignment.
- Awaiting user confirmation to proceed to Execution phase for coding and integration of DefectXray MVP.

**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the LLMRPG project. It is intended to be a frequently referenced, high-level summary to maintain project momentum and team alignment.

**Use Guidelines:**
- **Current Work Focus:**  List the 2-3 *most critical* tasks currently being actively worked on. Keep descriptions concise and action-oriented.
- **Next Steps:**  List the immediate next steps required to advance the project. Prioritize and order these steps for clarity.
- **Active Decisions and Considerations:** Document key decisions currently being considered or actively debated. Capture the essence of the decision and any open questions.
- **Do NOT include:** Detailed task breakdowns, historical changes, long-term plans (these belong in other memory bank files like `progress.md` or dedicated documentation).
- **Maintain Brevity:** Keep this file concise and focused on the *current* state of the project. Regularly review and prune outdated information.

## Current Work Focus:
- Finalizing review of all task instruction files for MVP components to ensure completeness.
- Preparing for transition to Execution phase by verifying task dependencies and sequencing.

## Next Steps:
1. Complete review of all task instructions for accuracy and dependency alignment.
2. Update `hierarchical_task_checklist.md` to reflect completion of Strategy phase tasks.
3. Confirm with user readiness to transition to Execution phase, targeting coding start in June 2025.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- Determining if any additional planning or documentation is needed before Execution phase.
- Ensuring all task instructions are atomic and actionable for development teams.
- Confirming with user any specific priorities or adjustments for task execution order.
