# Active Context for DefectXray

## Current State
- **Phase**: Strategy
- **Last Action**: Updated task instructions (Tasks 1, 3, 5, 6) and created planning documents (ODC Gap Handling, Customization Guide, Security Checklist, Prototype Plan, Task Dependency Flowchart) for DefectXray MVP.
- **Task Progress**:
  - **Task 1 (Severity Mapping Rules)**: Updated with custom keyword validation warnings, configurable severity weights (70% Defect Type, 30% Activity), expanded validation dataset (20-30 defects from 3-4 CI/CD pipelines), and data collection plan for June 2025. Deliverables track 80% precision metric.
  - **Task 3 (Import Module)**: Updated with keyword priority default for parsing, flexible batch processing target (1-3 minutes for 10,000 defects), manual override analysis for MVP, expanded tool integration (Jira, Sentry, GitLab), and scalability for 100,000 defects.
  - **Task 5 (Reporting Dashboard)**: Updated with scalability for 100,000 defects, feedback widget for beta, and performance target (<2 seconds load for 1,000 defects).
  - **Task 6 (API Endpoints)**: Updated with OAuth 2.0, rate limiting (100/minute default, 500/minute max), audit logging, and scalability for 1,000 requests/minute.
  - **New Planning Documents**: Created ODC Gap Handling Strategy, Customization Guide, Security Checklist, Prototype Plan, and Task Dependency Flowchart to support MVP planning.
- **Dependency Analysis**: Attempted to conduct dependency analysis for Tasks 1-6 to confirm Execution phase sequencing, but encountered technical issues with command execution. This needs to be resolved to finalize dependency checks.

## Decisions
- **Prioritization**: Focused on updating task instructions with customization, scalability, and security requirements as per user feedback, targeting May 15, 2025, completion.
- **Planning Documents**: Developed additional strategy documents by May 20, 2025, to address ODC integration, user customization, security, beta testing, and task sequencing.
- **Dependency Analysis**: Deferred full analysis due to technical issues with `show-dependencies` command; will revisit once resolved to ensure accurate task sequencing for Execution phase.

## Next Steps
- **Dependency Analysis**: Resolve technical issues with dependency processor commands to complete analysis for Tasks 1-6 sequencing by May 15, 2025.
- **User Feedback**: Await user confirmation on current plan direction, prioritized suggestions, and any further refinements.
- **Strategy Completion**: Finalize any remaining strategy tasks and prepare for potential transition to Execution phase after dependency verification and user approval.

## Decisions and Rationale
- **Prioritization**: Focused on accuracy (Tasks 1, 3) and security (Task 6) as top priorities per user guidance, with usability (Task 5) as secondary to meet timeline constraints.
- **Scope Adjustments**: Deferred non-critical features (e.g., Task 3 complex regex, Task 5 full accessibility) to post-MVP (January 2026) to protect beta timeline (November-December 2025).
- **Metrics Integration**: Added beta success metrics to task deliverables for tracking during development and beta phases.

## Priorities and Next Steps
- **Immediate Priority**: Complete updates to task documents and create new planning documents (e.g., ODC gap handling, customization guide, security checklist) based on user feedback by May 15, 2025.
- **Next Action**: Continue refining Strategy phase documents, including dependency analysis, prototype planning, and user training materials. Await user feedback on prioritized suggestions and further refinements.
- **Timeline**: Complete Strategy phase updates by May 20, 2025, to support June 2025 execution start if confirmed. Draft additional implementation plans and flowcharts by May 25, 2025.

## Decisions & Priorities
- **Primary Goal**: Develop a cloud-based platform for defect severity analysis to aid prioritization in enterprise CI/CD workflows, targeting an MVP by August 2025, enhanced by ODC for strategic process insights.
- **Key Decisions**: 
  - Focus on severity classification (low, medium, high) with basic ODC attributes (Defect Type, Activity) for MVP.
  - Plan for post-MVP integration of additional ODC attributes (e.g., Trigger) and advanced analytics (root cause analysis) by November 2025, using rule-based logic initially and ML later.
  - Implement ODC in-house using public resources (e.g., IEEE papers, Chillarege documentation), with optional consulting if needed.
  - Ensure integration with tools like Jira and Sentry, with customization for enterprise needs and mechanisms to handle ODC metadata gaps via heuristics and user prompts.
  - Incorporate user feedback mechanisms to build trust and improve both severity and ODC classifications over time.
- **Priorities**: 
  - Validate task instructions and dependencies for MVP components to ensure readiness for Execution phase.
  - Address stakeholder concerns (accuracy, security, customization, training) through beta feedback planning.
  - Confirm with the user any final adjustments to task scope or sequencing before transitioning to Execution phase.

## Impact & Next Steps
- **Impact**: The completed task instructions provide a clear roadmap for DefectXray's MVP development, aligning with immediate enterprise needs for defect prioritization and setting a strong foundation for long-term value through ODC-driven process insights.
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Review updated task instructions (Tasks 1, 3, 5, and 6) for completeness and alignment with user feedback on classification accuracy, dashboard interactivity, and API security.
  - Confirm with user if the project plan and task instructions meet expectations for the MVP focused on severity classification and ODC integration.
  - Transition to Execution phase to begin implementation of DefectXray MVP components, starting with database schema and severity rules (Tasks 1 and 2), pending user confirmation.
