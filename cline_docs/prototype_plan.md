# Prototype Plan for DefectXray MVP

## Purpose
This document outlines the plan for developing and testing a prototype of DefectXray MVP, targeting beta user feedback collection in July 2025 to validate core features (severity classification, ODC integration) before the full launch in August 2025.

## Prototype Scope
The prototype will include core MVP functionalities to demonstrate value to enterprise beta users and gather actionable feedback. Key components include:
- **Severity Classification**: Basic rule-based severity mapping (Task 1) with user override capability.
- **Import Module**: Simplified data ingestion from Jira and CSV uploads (Task 3), with heuristic ODC gap handling.
- **Reporting Dashboard**: Core visualizations for severity and ODC attributes (Task 5), with basic filtering and feedback widget.
- **API Endpoints**: Limited endpoints for data import and query (Task 6), secured with OAuth.

## Objectives
- **Validation**: Confirm that severity classification achieves 80% precision on a beta dataset (target: 100-200 defects per user).
- **Usability**: Achieve 75% user satisfaction rate via feedback widget for dashboard usability and overall experience.
- **Performance**: Validate import speed (target: 1,000 defects/hour) and dashboard load time (<2 seconds for 1,000 defects).
- **Feedback**: Identify critical pain points and feature gaps for MVP refinement, focusing on enterprise integration needs.

## Beta User Selection
- **Target**: 3-5 enterprise clients with diverse CI/CD workflows (e.g., Jira, Sentry, GitLab) and defect volumes (>500 defects/month).
- **Criteria**: Selected based on willingness to provide detailed feedback, cloud-based CI/CD setup, and representation of varied industries (e.g., finance, tech, healthcare).
- **Recruitment**: Draft a 'Beta User Profile' document by June 2025 to outline ideal criteria and outreach strategy (e.g., LinkedIn, industry forums).

## Prototype Development Timeline
- **May 2025**: Finalize prototype scope and integrate into task deliverables (Tasks 1, 3, 5, 6).
- **June 2025**: Develop prototype components:
  - Severity rules and override UI (Task 1).
  - Import connectors for Jira and CSV (Task 3).
  - Basic dashboard with severity charts and feedback widget (Task 5).
  - Secure API endpoints for data flow (Task 6).
- **Early July 2025**: Internal testing of prototype with simulated data (1,000 defects) to ensure stability and performance baselines.

## Beta Testing Plan
- **Duration**: Mid-July 2025 (2-3 weeks), ending by July 31, 2025.
- **Setup**: Provide beta users with access to hosted prototype instance (cloud-based), including Quick Start Guide and Severity FAQ.
- **Tasks for Users**:
  - Import defect data (minimum 100 defects) via Jira connector or CSV upload.
  - Review severity classifications and use override feature for at least 10 defects.
  - Explore dashboard visualizations and apply filters for analysis.
  - Submit feedback via widget on accuracy, usability, and integration.
- **Feedback Collection**: Design a structured feedback form focusing on import speed, classification accuracy, dashboard usability, and tool integration issues, targeting 75% satisfaction.

## Success Metrics
- **Participation**: At least 3 beta users complete testing with minimum data import (100 defects each).
- **Accuracy**: Severity classification matches user expectations or overrides in 80% of cases.
- **Performance**: Import module processes 1,000 defects/hour with <5% metadata mapping errors; dashboard loads in <2 seconds for 1,000 defects.
- **Satisfaction**: 75% of beta users rate experience as 4/5 or higher via feedback widget.

## Post-Testing Actions
- **Analysis**: Aggregate feedback by July 31, 2025, categorizing into usability, accuracy, performance, and feature requests.
- **Refinement**: Prioritize fixes and enhancements for MVP based on feedback severity (e.g., critical bugs fixed by August 1, 2025; usability tweaks by August 10, 2025).
- **Follow-Up**: Schedule follow-up calls with beta users in early August 2025 to clarify feedback and confirm MVP adjustments meet expectations.

## Dependencies
- **Task 1 (Severity Mapping Rules)**: Must provide basic rules and override UI for prototype.
- **Task 3 (Import Module)**: Must support Jira and CSV import with ODC heuristics.
- **Task 5 (Reporting Dashboard)**: Must include core visualizations and feedback widget.
- **Task 6 (API Endpoints)**: Must secure data flow for prototype.
- **Beta User Profile (cline_docs/beta_user_profile.md)**: Needed for recruitment strategy.

## Timeline Summary
- **June 2025**: Complete prototype development and draft 'Beta User Profile'.
- **Early July 2025**: Internal testing and beta user onboarding.
- **Mid-July 2025**: Beta testing phase with 3-5 users (2-3 weeks).
- **July 31, 2025**: Feedback collection complete.
- **August 2025**: Refine MVP based on feedback for launch.
