# DefectXray Requirements Document

## Introduction
DefectXray is a standalone product designed for enterprise CI/CD and testing workflows. It aims to analyze defects across all testing phases, classify their severity (low, medium, high), generate detailed reports, and provide fix recommendations. This document outlines the detailed functional and non-functional requirements for DefectXray, ensuring it meets enterprise needs for software quality and efficiency.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Defect Detection Module
- **Purpose**: Identify defects during testing phases (unit, integration, end-to-end).
- **Requirements**:
  - Integrate with testing frameworks such as Jest (unit tests), Playwright (end-to-end tests), and Mocha (backend tests).
  - Capture test failures and log metadata including failing test details, affected code, stack trace, and test environment.
  - Use static code analysis tools (e.g., ESLint, SonarQube) to identify potential issues pre-test execution.
  - Support multiple programming languages and frameworks relevant to enterprise stacks (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java).

### 2. Severity Analysis Engine
- **Purpose**: Classify defects based on impact across the software stack.
- **Requirements**:
  - Classify defects into three severity levels:
    - **Low**: Affects only UI (e.g., CSS misalignment in a React component).
    - **Medium**: Impacts UI and backend/data models (e.g., incorrect API response affecting UI display).
    - **High**: Affects UI, backend, and database (e.g., form submission failure due to database constraint violation).
  - Analyze defect metadata to determine impact scope and assign severity based on predefined rules.
  - Allow customization of severity classification rules by enterprise users to adapt to specific project needs.

### 3. Fix Recommendation Engine
- **Purpose**: Provide actionable fix suggestions for identified defects.
- **Requirements**:
  - Generate fix recommendations based on defect type, severity, and affected components using a knowledge base and machine learning models.
  - Offer code snippets or pseudocode for common defect patterns (e.g., null pointer exceptions, API timeout handling).
  - Integrate with version control systems to suggest relevant commit history or related fixes.
  - Support prioritization of fixes based on severity and business impact.

### 4. Reporting Dashboard
- **Purpose**: Visualize defect data and analysis for stakeholders.
- **Requirements**:
  - Provide a React-based UI with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design.
  - Display defect statistics (e.g., total defects, severity distribution, trends over time) in charts and graphs.
  - Allow filtering and drill-down capabilities by project, component, severity, or time period.
  - Export reports in PDF, CSV, or JSON formats for enterprise reporting needs.
  - Support real-time updates via WebSocket or periodic polling for live defect monitoring during CI/CD runs.

### 5. Integration with CI/CD Pipelines
- **Purpose**: Seamlessly embed DefectXray into enterprise development workflows.
- **Requirements**:
  - Provide CLI tools and API endpoints for integration with CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and GitLab CI.
  - Support automated defect detection and reporting during pipeline execution.
  - Enable configuration of DefectXray settings via pipeline scripts or environment variables.
  - Offer webhooks or callback mechanisms to notify external systems of defect analysis results.

### 6. Collaboration Tool Integration
- **Purpose**: Enhance team coordination by linking defect analysis to collaboration platforms.
- **Requirements**:
  - Integrate with tools like Jira, Slack, and Microsoft Teams for defect notification and tracking.
  - Automatically create tickets or send alerts for high-severity defects with relevant metadata.
  - Support bi-directional updates (e.g., defect status changes in Jira reflected in DefectXray).

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Security
- **Authentication**: Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure user authentication and authorization, supporting enterprise identity providers (e.g., Azure AD, Okta).
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection regulations by anonymizing sensitive defect metadata.
- **Encryption**: Use AES-256 for data at rest and TLS 1.3 for data in transit to protect defect data and user information.
- **Access Control**: Provide role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to defect data based on user roles (e.g., developer, manager, auditor).

### 2. Compliance
- **Auditability**: Maintain audit logs of defect analysis and user interactions for compliance purposes (e.g., SOC 2).
- **Data Retention**: Allow configurable data retention policies for defect metadata to meet enterprise compliance requirements.
- **Anonymization**: Implement mechanisms to anonymize defect data used for machine learning training to prevent exposure of proprietary code or data.

### 3. Performance and Scalability
- **Throughput**: Handle analysis of at least 10,000 defects per hour to support large enterprise applications.
- **Latency**: Ensure defect analysis and reporting complete within 5 seconds for 95% of cases under normal load.
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling on Azure AKS, supporting autoscaling based on workload (e.g., number of concurrent CI/CD pipeline runs).
- **Reliability**: Achieve 99.9% uptime for the cloud-based platform to ensure availability during critical development phases.

### 4. Usability
- **User Interface**: Ensure the reporting dashboard is intuitive, with minimal training required for enterprise users.
- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive user guides, API documentation, and integration tutorials for developers and DevOps teams.
- **Accessibility**: Adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for the dashboard to support users with disabilities.

### 5. Compatibility
- **Browsers**: Support the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari for the reporting dashboard.
- **CI/CD Tools**: Ensure compatibility with major CI/CD platforms including GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, and Azure DevOps.
- **Testing Frameworks**: Support integration with popular testing frameworks across languages (e.g., Jest, Mocha, JUnit, pytest).

## Business Requirements

- **Pricing Model**: Support a tiered pricing structure:
  - Basic tier for defect classification only.
  - Premium tier for classification plus fix recommendations and advanced reporting.
- **Licensing**: Enable enterprise licensing with volume discounts and customizable feature sets.
- **Support**: Offer 24/7 enterprise support with SLAs for critical issues, including dedicated account managers for large clients.

## Conclusion
This requirements document establishes the foundation for DefectXray as a comprehensive defect severity analysis tool tailored for enterprise CI/CD and testing workflows. By addressing functional, non-functional, and business requirements, including critical security and compliance needs, DefectXray aims to deliver significant value to enterprises by prioritizing defect resolution and streamlining development processes.
